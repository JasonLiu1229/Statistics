# Statistics Project 2022 - 2023
> This is the data analysis of the dataset eik.csv

## Assignment
In the assignment folder you will find the assignment in dutch.

### Context English
The assignment will tell us what kind of dateset we will receive. 
The questions we need to answer and how we need to answer the questions.

#### Dataset
> Explanation what the dataset concludes and translation  

The dataset will be about acorn trees that appear in the USA.
- Boom : Tree = the serial number of the acorn tree
- Regio : Region = the region the acorn tree appears in (‘Atlantic’ of ‘California’)
- Grootte : Area = the width of the area of where the acorn tree appears in (in 100 km<sup>2</sup>)
- Volume : Volume = the volume of the acorn (in cm<sup>3</sup>)
- Hoogte : Height = the height of the tree (in m)

Some elements are deleted from the original dataset, this is to make sure students have different datasets.
So different answers. Original dataset: eik_copy.csv

#### Questions
1. Study and discuss the distribution of the variables Volume and Size. 
To do this, discuss appropriate graphical representations. 
Also, formally examine whether the data is normally distributed. If this is not the case, 
in what way do the data deviate from normally distributed data? Discuss.
2. Check if there is a correlation between "thick acorns", 
which are oak trees with acorns with a volume of at least 3 cm<sup>3</sup>, 
and the area in which the tree occurs. To do this, create a new variable 'thick acorn'. Then, perform an appropriate test.
3. Can you predict the height from log(Volume)? 
Answer this question thoroughly and as completely as possible.
